### New documentation ###
After many recent changes we have given the docs an overhaul so they reflect the current state of Yabi. You can read them here: http://www.ccgapps.com.au/yabi-docs/

### Changes needed ###
This release makes the major structural change of merging the Yabi Frontend application into Yabiadmin. There are database migrations that should apply cleanly to set up user profiles to determine user's access to the Accounts tab within the frontend. After deploying check your Auth User and Yabi User tables in the Admin to ensure settings are correct.

After running this update both the Yabi frontend and the admin will be on the same address. You may need to change the backend configuration to reflect this.


### Deployment ###
If you are using the Fabric files included in this project for installation you would install Yabiadmin like this:

Release process is:

```
clone the repo or 'hg pull -u'
```

Then we need to release each component individually (yabiadmin and yabibe)

#### Yabiadmin ####

```
stop celeryd
cd into yabiadmin/yabiadmin directory.
rm -rf virt_yabiadmin/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh
source virt_yabiadmin/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
```


#### Restart the web server and celery ####

```
restart the web server
start celeryd
```

#### Yabibe ####

```
cd into yabibe/yabibe directory.
rm -rf virt_yabibe/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh -r requirements.txt
source virt_yabibe/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
restart yabibe
```
