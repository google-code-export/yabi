### Changes needed ###
Changes have been made to the init.d script controlling the backend to better facilitate serialisation of jobs on shutdown. If you are using this you should use the updated version.


### Deployment ###
If you are using the Fabric files included in this project for installation you would install Yabiadmin like this:

Release process is:

```
clone the repo or 'hg pull -u'
```

Then we need to release each component individually (yabiadmin and yabibe)

#### Yabiadmin ####

```
stop celeryd
cd into yabiadmin/yabiadmin directory.
rm -rf virt_yabiadmin/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh
source virt_yabiadmin/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
```


#### Restart the web server and celery ####

```
restart the web server
start celeryd
```

#### Yabibe ####

```
cd into yabibe/yabibe directory.
rm -rf virt_yabibe/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh -r requirements.txt
source virt_yabibe/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
restart yabibe
```
