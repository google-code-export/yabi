### Changes needed ###

This release changes the way in which job status is handled. There are schema and data migrations to alter existing databases. These can take some time to run.

### Important Django security update ###

Django 1.3.2 has been released to patch a few security issues (see https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/jul/30/security-releases-issued/). We have rolled Django 1.3.2 into this release so we highly recommend that you install this Yabi update.

### Deployment ###
If you are using the Fabric files included in this project for installation you would install Yabiadmin like this:

Release process is:

```
clone the repo or 'hg pull -u'
```

Then we need to release each component individually (yabiadmin and yabibe)

#### Yabiadmin ####

```
stop celeryd
cd into yabiadmin/yabiadmin directory.
rm -rf virt_yabiadmin/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh
source virt_yabiadmin/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
```


#### Restart the web server and celery ####

```
restart the web server
start celeryd
```

#### Yabibe ####

```
cd into yabibe/yabibe directory.
rm -rf virt_yabibe/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh -r requirements.txt
source virt_yabibe/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
restart yabibe
```
