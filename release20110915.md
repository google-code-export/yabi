### Changes needed ###

This release allows tools that consume command line arguments i.e.

`cat file1.fa file2.fa file3.fa`

It changes the way parameters accept files, providing 3 options: None, Batch or Consume. As a result you **must** run this sql patch on your database:

### Known Issues ###
  * when updating you must make a backup of yabiadmin and yabife settings.py files and reapply any changes to the new settings files. We are looking to streamline this process in a future release.

**Please note:**

Remember to make a backup of your yabiadmin and yabife settings.py files before running yum update.

They are found here:

```
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabife/release/yabife/settings.py
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabiadmin/release/yabiadmin/settings.py

```

After running the update I usually diff the backups against the new files and then either patch them by hand or using patch.
