### View Users Setup ###

There are a couple of admin tools that allow an administrator to view a users setup. First click on Users under the Yabi section ('''not''' under the Auth section). This will show you a list of users you have added to Yabi. Clicking on the Tools or Backend links will give you further detail.

#### User Tools ####

This listing will show you all the tools a user has access to and the tool groups the tools belong to.

#### User Backends ####

This listing will show you all the execution and filesystem backend credentials set up for the user. NB the filesystem backends have a Test link beside them that will cause Yabi to request a file listing for the backend. If it is successful then the credential for the user must be working.
