### Changes needed ###
This release makes changes to use file-based caching for the quickstart deployment. If you are currently using Memcache then be sure that you are setting memcache caching in your private settings file. See http://code.google.com/p/yabi/issues/detail?id=197 for details.

This release also makes changes to the SSH execution backend. See http://code.google.com/p/yabi/issues/detail?id=198 for details.

### Deployment ###
If you are using the Fabric files included in this project for installation you would install Yabiadmin like this:

Release process is:

```
clone the repo or 'hg pull -u'
```

Then we need to release each component individually (yabiadmin and yabibe)

#### Yabiadmin ####

```
stop celeryd
cd into yabiadmin/yabiadmin directory.
rm -rf virt_yabiadmin/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh
source virt_yabiadmin/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH

```


#### Restart the web server and celery ####

```
restart the web server
start celeryd
```

#### Yabibe ####

cd into yabibe/yabibe directory.
rm -rf virt_yabibe/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh -r requirements.txt
