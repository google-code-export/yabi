**Please note:**

Remember to make a back of your yabiadmin and yabife settings.py files before running yum update.

They are found here:

```
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabife/release/yabife/settings.py
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabiadmin/release/yabiadmin/settings.py

```

After running the update I usually diff the backups against the new files and then either patch them by hand or using patch.

### FE RELEASE\_44 ###
  * changes to facilitate the use of globs rather than file extensions
  * cosmetic changes

### Admin RELEASE\_71 ###
  * changes for using globs not extensions

### BE RELEASE\_44 ###
  * ssh+pbspro fixes

### DATABASE CHANGE ###
There is a very minor change required in the yabi\_live database.

```
BEGIN;
UPDATE yabi_fileextension SET pattern='*' WHERE pattern = '*.*';
COMMIT;
```


### KNOWN ISSUES ###
  * when updating you must make a backup of yabiadmin and yabife settings.py files and reapply any changes to the new settings files. We are looking to streamline this process in a future release.
