### Changes needed ###

This release makes changes to the way the backend handles running tasks when the backend is stopped and then restarted. Any tasks that are running during this upgrade will need to be reset to "ready" AFTER the upgrade has been performed. This can be done by:
  * viewing the Task record via the Workflow Summary page
  * clear all the status fields for the Task
  * setting the Status Ready status field to be today and now by clicking "Today" and then "Now"
  * click Save to save the record

**Alternately** you could set the tasks per user on all Execution Backends to 0 before the upgrade, let all jobs finish, run the upgrade then reset the tasks per user value on the Execution Backends to their previous values but this will make the upgrade process longer as you will have to wait for all jobs to complete prior to upgrading.


### Deployment ###
If you are using the Fabric files included in this project for installation you would install Yabiadmin like this:

Release process is:

```
clone the repo or 'hg pull -u'
```

Then we need to release each component individually (yabiadmin and yabibe)

#### Yabiadmin ####

```
stop celeryd
cd into yabiadmin/yabiadmin directory.
rm -rf virt_yabiadmin/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh
source virt_yabiadmin/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
```


#### Restart the web server and celery ####

```
restart the web server
start celeryd
```

#### Yabibe ####

```
cd into yabibe/yabibe directory.
rm -rf virt_yabibe/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh -r requirements.txt
source virt_yabibe/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
restart yabibe
```
