### Changes needed ###

#### Backend conf change ####
You **will** need to add the following to your yabi.conf file for the backend unless you are running only an admin server with self-signed cert. See http://code.google.com/p/yabi/issues/detail?id=210 for details:

```
#
# admin_cert_check: yes
# If the url for admin is https, then this setting controls if you want the certificate chain checked. If you are using
# a self signed SSL certificate on your yabiadmin server, and want to open yourself up to man in the middle attacks, set 
# this to no.
#
admin_cert_check: yes
```

#### Known hosts change ####
Yabi is now using known\_host keys that it stores in its own database. When it encounters a new host it will store a denied key in the Hostkeys table. You should then view the record in the Hostkey table and click allow if the key is valid. You will have to do this for the backends that you currently have set up to use ssh or scp.

See: http://www.ccgapps.com.au/yabi-docs/faq.html#i-seem-to-have-ssh-backend-setup-but-am-getting-nothing-why

**Please note:** The admin line your yabi.conf file for the backend **must** have a trailing slash i.e.
```
admin: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```


### Deployment ###
If you are using the Fabric files included in this project for installation you would install Yabiadmin like this:

Release process is:

```
clone the repo or 'hg pull -u'
```

Then we need to release each component individually (yabiadmin and yabibe)

#### Yabiadmin ####

```
stop celeryd
cd into yabiadmin/yabiadmin directory.
rm -rf virt_yabiadmin/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh
source virt_yabiadmin/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
```


#### Restart the web server and celery ####

```
restart the web server
start celeryd
```

#### Yabibe ####

```
cd into yabibe/yabibe directory.
rm -rf virt_yabibe/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh -r requirements.txt
source virt_yabibe/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
restart yabibe
```
