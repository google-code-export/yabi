### Changes needed ###
  * We are now using Django's caching mechanisms - you will need to make changes to the settings out lined here: http://code.google.com/p/yabi/issues/detail?id=179#c4
  * This release removes the dependency on stackless and moves to using gevent. You will need to install libevent, libevent-dev libraries on your system for gevent to compile.

### Deployment ###
If you are using the Fabric files included in this project for installation you would install Yabiadmin like this:

Release process is:

```
clone the repo or 'hg pull -u'
```

Then we need to release each component individually (yabife, yabiadmin and yabibe)

#### Yabife ####

```
cd into yabife/yabife directory.
rm -rf virt_yabife/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh
source virt_yabife/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
```

#### Yabiadmin ####

```
stop celeryd
cd into yabiadmin/yabiadmin directory.
rm -rf virt_yabiadmin/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh
source virt_yabiadmin/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
```


#### Restart the web server and celery ####

```
restart the web server
start celeryd
```

#### Yabibe ####

```
cd into yabibe/yabibe directory.
rm -rf virt_yabibe/
sh ../../bootstrap.sh -r requirements.txt
source virt_yabibe/bin/activate
unset PYTHONPATH
fab release
restart yabibe
```
