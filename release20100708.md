**Please note:**

Remember to make a backup of your yabiadmin and yabife settings.py files before running yum update.

They are found here:

```
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabife/release/yabife/settings.py
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabiadmin/release/yabiadmin/settings.py

```

After running the update I usually diff the backups against the new files and then either patch them by hand or using patch.

**Please note:**

We found an issue when uploading files via the front end. If you have entered your Appliance in the frontend admin without a trailing slash you will get an upload error.

eg appliance should be:
https://127.0.0.1/yabiadmin/  NOT  https://127.0.0.1/yabiadmin

See: http://code.google.com/p/yabi/wiki/AddAppliance
