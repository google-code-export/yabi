### Changes needed ###

As authentication between admin and backend has been improved you will need to add HMAC keys:
[Generating HMAC keys](Generating_HMAC_key.md)

### Known Issues ###
  * when updating you must make a backup of yabiadmin and yabife settings.py files and reapply any changes to the new settings files. We are looking to streamline this process in a future release.

**Please note:**

Remember to make a backup of your yabiadmin and yabife settings.py files before running yum update.

They are found here:

```
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabife/release/yabife/settings.py
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabiadmin/release/yabiadmin/settings.py

```

After running the update I usually diff the backups against the new files and then either patch them by hand or using patch.
