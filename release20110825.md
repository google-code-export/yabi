**Please note:**

Remember to make a backup of your yabiadmin and yabife settings.py files before running yum update.

They are found here:

```
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabife/release/yabife/settings.py
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabiadmin/release/yabiadmin/settings.py

```

After running the update I usually diff the backups against the new files and then either patch them by hand or using patch.

Further details: [Configuration](Configuration.md), [Updating Yabi](Updating.md)

```
yabife-release-2.00
yabiadmin-release-2.00
yabibe-release-2.00
```

This release has a number of changes. There are some changes you will need to make to keep things running.

### Settings File LDAP changes ###
If you are using LDAP the following settings will need to be added using appropriate values in both the yabife and yabiadmin settings.py files.

```
AUTH_LDAP_GROUPOC = 'groupofuniquenames'
AUTH_LDAP_USEROC = 'inetorgperson'
AUTH_LDAP_MEMBERATTR = 'uniqueMember'
AUTH_LDAP_USERDN = 'ou=People'
```

### Syslog Handler ###
We have enabled logging to syslog. If this is giving you any problems you can turn this off in the ccglogging/init.py file

### Password Changing ###
You will need to add this line to your settings file for yabife and yabiadmin.

```
AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'yabifeapp.LDAPBackendUser'
or
AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'yabifeapp.ModelBackendUser'
```
This depends on what kind of Auth you are using.

### SQL patches ###

### KNOWN ISSUES ###
  * when updating you must make a backup of yabiadmin and yabife settings.py files and reapply any changes to the new settings files. We are looking to streamline this process in a future release.
