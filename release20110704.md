**Please note:**

_When a new version of Yabi is released, it is placed in a new directory parallel to the old release. If you have made changes to either the Frontend or Admin settings.py file before upgrading you will need to move your changes to the new release directory. At the moment this will be the changes you made at the [Configuration](Configuration.md) step. See [Updating Yabi](Updating.md) for details of this and the filesystem layout._

This release introduces SSH+PBSPRO. If you are **not** going to be using PBSPro then you need not install this update.

### FE RELEASE\_43 ###
  * stored egg installation instead of downloaded

### Admin RELEASE\_69 ###
  * stored egg installation instead of downloaded

### BE RELEASE\_41 ###
  * ssh+qsub renamed to ssh+torque
  * paramiko fixes
  * ssh+pbspro backend added
  * debug logging improvements
  * stored egg installation instead of downloaded or system

### KNOWN ISSUES ###
  * when adding a tool that will use SSH+PBSPRO entering anything in the Queue, Max Memory or Job Type fields will lead to a credential error at execution time. This issue will be addressed in the next release.
  * the AddTool page and the Tool JSON pages are currently producing errors related to the change from file extensions to file globbing. A fix for this is pending.
