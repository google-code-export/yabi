**Please note:**

Remember to make a backup of your yabiadmin and yabife settings.py files before running yum update.

They are found here:

```
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabife/release/yabife/settings.py
 /usr/local/python/ccgapps/yabiadmin/release/yabiadmin/settings.py

```

After running the update I usually diff the backups against the new files and then either patch them by hand or using patch.

This release addresses an issue where the backend was having problems parsing the ls output from different machines. This is intended as a temporary fix with a reworked solution pending see: http://code.google.com/p/yabi/issues/detail?id=50

### KNOWN ISSUES ###
  * when updating you must make a backup of yabiadmin and yabife settings.py files and reapply any changes to the new settings files. We are looking to streamline this process in a future release.
